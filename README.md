# Human Resources
This mod for the [HBS BattleTech](http://battletechgame.com/) game breathes life into the crews onboard the Argo. Aerospace pilots, MechTech crews, MedTech crews, and Vehicle crews can be acquired from the Hiring Hall. These crew require a hiring bonus in addition to their monthly salary, offer contracts of varying lengths, and will have their own loyalties to manage. These crews are mercenaries and will leave at the end of their contract, or when someone makes them a better offer. You'll always have Wang, Sumire and the rest - but otherwise you'll need to keep an eye on the people that form the backbone of your mercenary company.

**Features**

 * Hirable Aerospace, MechTech, MedTech, and Vehicle crews in the Hiring Hall
 * Fully customizable salary and hiring bonus calculations based upon an exponential formula
 * Scarcity of all hirable crews based upon planetary tags
 * Scarcity of all hirable crews driven by a gaussian distribution
 * Crews have a customizable contract length
 * (Optional) Crews can be poached by other employers when the conditions are right

### Combat Crews and Support Crews

This mod distinguishes between *Combat Crews* (MechWarriors and Vehicle Crews) and *Support Crews* (Aerospace Wings, MechTech Crews, and MedTech Crews). Some configuration elements will be common across these two types.

*Combat Crews* are handled normally, though their distribution and prices are handled by the mod. Overall there are few changes to these units. Vehicle Crews are treated as MechWarriors, but assigned the `pilot_vehicle_crew` and `pilot_nomech_crew` tags for CustomUnits compatibility.

*Support Crews* are given a skill and size rating. Both ratings go from 1-5, and are labeled in `mod_localization.json` by their rating:

| Name | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Skill | Rookie | Regular | Veteran | Elite | Legendary |
| Size | Tiny | Small | Medium | Large | Huge |

# Hiring 

All crews are available to be hired from the HiringHall. Mechwarriors are untouched, but all other crews are represented with different icons:

### Salary

A crew's base salary is driven by an exponential function `ab^x` where a = `SalaryMulti`, b = `SalaryExponent` and x = the value of the pilot, rounded down to the nearest integer value. A pilot's value is defined as the number of points they contribute (Aerospace, MedTech, MechTech) or the sum of all their skills (MechWarriors or Vehicle Crews). 

> Example: For a SalaryMulti of 30,000 and SalaryExponent of 1.1:
>
> A MechWarrior with gunnery 2, guts 3, piloting 2, and tactics 2 would have a base salary of (30,000) x (1.1 ^ (2 + 3 + 2 + 2)) = 70,738.43 = 70,738.
>
> A Vehicle crew with gunnery 7, guts 8, piloting 9, and tactics 7 would have a base salary of (30,000) x (1.1 ^ (7 + 8 + 9 + 7)) = 575,830.274 = 575,830.
>
> A MedTech crew with MechTech points 12 would have a base salary of (30,000) x (1.1 ^ 12) = 94,152.85 = 94,152.

Once the base salary is calculated, a variance is applied to randomize the amount. This is controlled by the `SalaryVariance` multiplier.  A random value between the base salary and the salary x `SalaryVariance` will be used as the final salary the mercenary asks for.

Each mercenary asks for a hiring bonus when their contract is renewed. This bonus is calculated using the same formula as the salary, but used `BonusVariance` multiplier instead. 

> Example: A mercenary with base salary 95,000 has `SalaryVariance` = 1.1 and `BonusVariance` = 1.5. 
>
> Their salary will be randomly chosen between 95,000 and 104,500 (i.e. 95,000 x 1.1)
>
> Their bonus will be randomly chosen between 95,000 and 142,500 (i.e. 95,000 x 1.5)

### Contract Length

When you sign a contract with a mercenary, it's only good for a certain number of days. When a crew is created, a random contract length is determined for them and they will always use this contract length no matter how many times they are hired. The length is determined by calculating a random integer between `MinContractDaysMulti` and `MaxContractDaysMulti`, and multiplying that random integer by `BaseDaysInContract`. 

> Example: A crew has MinContractDaysMulti = 3, MaxContractDaysMulti = 12, and BaseDaysInContract 15. A random value between 3 and 12 will be chosen,  in this case 8. That's then multiplied by 15 for 8 x 15 = 120 days.

### Crew Limits

You may not want players to be able to acquire too many crews of the same time. If `MaxOfType` is set to -1, any number of crews can be hired up to the current berth limits. If `MaxOfType` is set to a value greater 0, the player won't be able to hire more than `MaxOfType` crews.

> Example: If MedTechCrews.MaxOfType = 2, then the player cannot hire more than 2 MedTech crews.

### Skill and Size Distribution

Support Crew skill and size are randomly determined, using a [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) distribution. These distributions are customizable through the `SkillDistribution` and `SizeDistribution` values in mod.json. Each distribution is configured with a *Sigma* and *Mu* value, representing the standard deviation of the distribution and the center-point of the distribution. *Mu* represents the most common value in the distribution around which all other values will cluster.

Each distribution also defines four breakpoints representing the progression from rating 1 to 5 for the values. Values below the first breakpoint will be treated as rating 1, values below the second breakpoint will be treated as rating 2, etc. These are defined in the `SkillDistribution.Breakpoints` and `SizeDistribution.Breakpoints` arrays.

> Example: The skill distribution is setup with a sigma of 1, a mu of 0, and breakpoints of [ -1, 1, 2, 3 ]. Most random values will center around point 0. If a value of -3.8 is pulled from the distribution, it will be treated as rating of 1. If value of 1.3 is pulled from the distribution, it will be treated as a rating of 3. 

### Scarcity

The availability of crews are determined on a planet by planet basis, through planet tags. Each crew type (Aerospace, MechWarrior, etc) is given a default scarcity defined in `Scarcity.Defaults`. The `Scarcity.PlanetTagModifiers` dictionary allows you to associate a specific planet tag with modifiers to those scarcity defaults. The format for a modifier is: ` "planet_tag" : { "MechWarriors" : 0.0, "VehicleCrews" : 1.0, "MechTechs" : 2.0, "MedTechs" : 3.0, "Aerospace" : 4.0 }`. 

All the modifiers from all the tags on the planet are added together, the rounded up to the nearest integer to determine the maximum number of each crew that will be randomly generated. The lower bound of each crew type is half the upper bound, rounded to zero. 

> Example: The tag modifiers includes `planet_other_capital` with `MedTechs=1.3`, `planet_pop_small` with `Medtechs=0.8` and `planet_industry_recreation` with `MedTechs=0.5`. The sum of these is 2.6, which is rounded up to 3 for the upper bound. The lower bound is half the upper bound rounded down, or 3 / 2 = 1.5 for 1. This planet will generate between 1 and 3 MedTechs.

# Crew Value

### Combat Crew Value

The value of a combat crew is determined as the sum of all their skills, plus any bonuses for those skills. 

### AeroSpace Points

Aerospace points are applied to the statistic `HR_AerospaceSkill`. It's not used directly by any mechanic in the HBS game, but may be used by other mods. The allocation of points are determined by the configuration in `PointsBySkillAndSize.Aerospace`.

| Crew Size | Rookie | Regular | Veteran | Elite | Legendary |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ----- | --------- |
| Tiny      | 1      | 2       | 3       | 5     | 8         |
| Small     | 2      | 4       | 6       | 10    | 16        |
| Medium    | 3      | 6       | 9       | 15    | 24        |
| Large     | 4      | 8       | 12      | 20    | 32        |
| Huge      | 5      | 10      | 15      | 25    | 40        |

### MechTech Points

MechTech points are applied to the CompanyStat `MechTechSkill`. This value determines how quickly the Mech workqueue is resolved. The allocation of points are determined by the configuration in `PointsBySkillAndSize.MechTech`.

| Crew Size | Rookie | Regular | Veteran | Elite | Legendary |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ----- | --------- |
| Tiny      | 1      | 2       | 3       | 5     | 8         |
| Small     | 2      | 4       | 6       | 10    | 16        |
| Medium    | 3      | 6       | 9       | 15    | 24        |
| Large     | 4      | 8       | 12      | 20    | 32        |
| Huge      | 5      | 10      | 15      | 25    | 40        |

### MedTech Points

MedTech points are applied to the CompanyStat `MedTechSkill`. This value determines how quickly the injuries work queue is resolved. The allocation of points are determined by the configuration in `PointsBySkillAndSize.MedTech`.

| Crew Size | Rookie | Regular | Veteran | Elite | Legendary |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ----- | --------- |
| Tiny      | 1      | 2       | 3       | 5     | 8         |
| Small     | 2      | 4       | 6       | 10    | 16        |
| Medium    | 3      | 6       | 9       | 15    | 24        |
| Large     | 4      | 8       | 12      | 20    | 32        |
| Huge      | 5      | 10      | 15      | 25    | 40        |

* Descriptions for MedTechs/MercTechs
  * Background
  * Attributes
  * Faction loyalty
* Hiring cost varies by planet tag *not* faction owner
  * Faction reputation influences the cost (if they are faction affiliated and you are hated, more expensive)
* Firing events takes forever according to t-bone; profile when firing the event
* skill distribution mu and sigma modified by planet tags

* Mercenary loyalty
  * Low morale decays their loyalty to your crew
  * Fighting against their faction has a slight reduction
  * Pilot losses impact their loyalty
  * Morale increases their loyalty slightly
  * Company reputation; go with options that make you hated and it becomes harder to hire
  * After AAR report, will complain if you work against their faction
  * Poaching - sometimes they will want to break a contract (for more pay) and you have to decide what to do
* Max injuries should be hidden on hiring screen
* BUG: Colors not updating when you first look at screen
* BUG: Colors not updating for Mechs in list
* Contract desc / pilot isn't getting reset between events
* Loyalty shouldn't ensure a no-hire bonus, only make it easier
