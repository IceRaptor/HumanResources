# Human Resources
This mod for the [HBS BattleTech](http://battletechgame.com/) game breathes life into the crews onboard the Argo. MechTech, MedTech, and Vehicle crews can be hired as 'pilots' in the Hiring Hall. These crew are harder to manage, require a monthly salary, and have their own loyalty that's influenced by your actions. They are also mercenaries, and can leave at end of a contract or when someone else makes them a better offer! You'll always have Wang, Sumire and the rest - but otherwise you'll need to keep an eye on the people that form the backbone of your mercenary company.

You should disable or remove the above mods before activating this mod.
